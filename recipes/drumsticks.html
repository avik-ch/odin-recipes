        <ol class="block-last-element">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Transfer chicken drumsticks into a resealable plastic bag placed over a bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add habanero pepper, rice vinegar, and soy sauce to a blender or blender cup, 
                    and blend on high for about 30 seconds. Transfer into a bowl. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Add honey, garlic powder, onion powder, chili flakes, cayenne, and chili 
                    paste to the bowl and whisk until evenly combined. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Pour marinade into the bag with chicken, and carefully massage the outside 
                    of the bag until drumsticks are evenly coated. Squeeze out excess air and seal 
                    the bag tightly. 
                </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p>
                    Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 10 hours for best 
                    results. (If necessary, chicken can be cooked immediately, but drumsticks will be 
                    more flavorful if marinated for a few hours.) 
                </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Transfer chicken and marinade 
                    into a casserole dish, and space drumsticks evenly into a single layer. 
                </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes; remove from the oven and 
                    turn chicken pieces over. 
                </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p>
                    Continue to bake drumsticks until meat is very tender and beginning to 
                    brown, about 45 minutes more; turn or baste drumsticks every 15 minutes. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Remove drumsticks to a serving platter and cover loosely with foil. 
                    Carefully pour all the liquids from the roasting dish into a saucepan, and 
                    bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook sauce until it starts to 
                    thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. 
                </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p>
                    Spoon sauce over drumsticks. Scatter freshly snipped chives over chicken to serve. 
                </p>
            </li>
