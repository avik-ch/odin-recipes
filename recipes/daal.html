    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Daal is basically a lentil stew. I don't really know what more to say so I'm just going to copy what
        the original author wrote in their post. Here is my recipe for dhal based on my many experiences 
        cooking with my friends over the years. We love this served over freshly made basmati rice. Don't 
        skimp on the caramelized onions and garlic â€” it totally makes this recipe amazing!
    </p>
    

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup red lentils</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1 cup onion, thinly sliced, divided</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>3/4 cup cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 (2inch) whole serrano chile peppers (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Wash lentils in a strainer. Combine lentils and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat. 
            Add 1/2 of the sliced onions and garlic, reserving the rest for later. Stir in turmeric, 
            bay leaf, tomatoes, and salt. Add chiles, leaving them whole to add flavor or cut in half 
            to add heat. When mixture begins to boil, reduce heat to a simmer; cook until lentils break 
            apart and thicken slightly, about 20 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Meanwhile, in a skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat until oil shimmers. Add reserved 
            sliced onions; cook and stir until onion has softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce 
            heat to medium-low; continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender and dark brown, 
            15 to 20 minutes more. Stir in reserved garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is 
            fragrant and tender, about 2 minutes. </p></li>
        <li><p>Add onion-garlic mixture into cooked lentils and stir. Garnish with chopped cilantro. </p></li>
    </ol>
